.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
ABNF ("Advanced Backus Naur Form")
grammars are frequently used in RFCs to describe protocols or 
presentation formats for Internet Standards.
The \fIabnfgen\fP program produces text composed according to the rules of an
ABNF grammar, given the grammar.
Such text can then be used to test a parser that claims
to implement the grammar.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
Print a brief usage.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode.
Print a trace of the expanded grammar rules to standard error.
.TP
.B \-w 
Write seed.
Begin each generated file with \fIprefix\fR, followed by the seed
as a decimal number and a newline.
.TP
.B \-c
Try for complete coverage.
Rather than randomly picking productions, try to cover each
leaf and branch of the grammar.
.IP
For repetitions with * where maximum and minimum are less than
100 iterations apart, the repetition counts as fully covered
when both maximum and minimum have been produced.
(The stages in between are only tried once the extremes have
been covered.)
.IP
For repetitions with * where maximum and minimum are more than 
100 apart, only the minimum and some small number of repetitions
are tried; doubling the \fB-c\fP removes that limit and causes
the extremes to be tried even if the maximum is very large.
.IP
For character ranges with up to 256 elements, each elements
must be produced for full coverage.
For (Unicode) character ranges with more than 256 elements,
every possible value modulo 256 is produced at least once for
complete coverage.
.IP
A case-insensitive strings counts as fully covered once both
an all-uppercase and an all-lowercase version have been produced.
.TP
.B \-y
Descend freely through at most \fIdepth\fP nonterminal expansions
or repetitions.
After recursing that deeply, always pick that branch of the grammar that
terminates most quickly.
This can be used to limit expansion in grammars likely to
recurse infinitely such as \fBa = a a a a | "x"\fP.
The default depth is 100.
.TP
.B \-n
Rather than generating output on standard output (the default),
generate \fIncases\fP test files named ####.tst, where #### is 
replaced with the test's running number from 1 to \fIncases\fP. 
.TP
.B \-p
Name test cases using \fIfilename-pattern\fP.
A sequence of # characters in the pattern is replaced with
the running number of the test, padded to the specified size.
.TP
.B \-r
Initialize the random generator using \fIseed\fP.
For the same grammar and version of the software,
the same seed always creates the same subtree.
.TP
.B \-s
Start production with \fIstart-symbol\fP.
(Default: the first nonterminal defined in the grammar file.)
.TP
.B \-t
Read the nonterminals defined in \fItentative-file\fP
and use them if they don't get defined in the regular input files.
.TP
.B \-u
Reject any grammar that contains <>-enclosed prose.
.TP
.B \-x
Exclude the core set of definitions.
The RFC that defines the grammar also defines a core set of
symbols like CRLF, DIGIT, SP and so on.
Since version 0.9, abnfgen predefines these symbols as if
their definition had been passed in with -t.
Specify -x to suppress those predefinitions.
.TP
.B \-7
Disable RFC 7405: do not interpret '%i"foo"' and '%s"foo"'
as case-insensitive or case-sensitive literals, respectively.
.TP
.B \-l
("legal") Disable extensions to RFCs 5234 and 7405: do not allow
case-sensitive literals in single quotes, do not allow
branch tagging with {}, and do not convert character constants
from Unicode to UTF-8.
.TP
.B \-_
Allow "_" as part of identifier names.
ABNF doesn't (it allows "-" instead), but many other
grammar systems do.
.SH GRAMMAR
The input grammar is a slight extension of ABNF with
provisions for literal strings and control of the chance
of descent into specific branches of the grammar.

.IP "\fInonterminal\fR \fB=\fR \fIexpression\fR"
The nonterminal expands to expression.
.IP "\fInonterminal\fR \fB=/\fR \fIexpression\fR"
Alternative to whatever else has been defined, the \fInonterminal\fP
can also expand to \fIexpression\fP.
.IP "\fIx\fP \fB/\fP \fIy\fP"
Either x or y.
.IP "\fIx\fP \fIy\fP"
X followed by y.
.IP \fB"abc"\fP
The case-insensitive string \fBabc\fR.  That is, one of 
ABC, ABc, AbC, Abc, aBC, aBc, abC, or abc.
There is no way of quoting " in a string; in a pinch, use <"> 
or %x22.
.IP \fB%s"abc"\fR
The case-sensitive string \fBabc\fR.  (An extension introduced in RFC 7405.)
Support for \fB%i"abc"\fR and \fB%s"abc"\fR can be turned off with -7.
.IP \fB%i"abc"\fR
The case-insensitive string \fBabc\fR.
Same as just \fB"abc"\fR. 
(This is an extension introduced in RFC 7405, for consistency with \fB%s\fR.)
Support for \fB%i"abc"\fR and \fB%s"abc"\fR can be turned off with -7.
.IP "\fB'abc'\fR"
The case-sensitive string \fBabc\fR.
This is a home-made extension to ABNF (that predates RFC7405),
and can be disabled using the \-l option.
There is no way of quoting ' in a string; use '"'"'.
(That is, leave the single-quoted string, enter a double-quoted
string, the single quote, leave the double-quoted string, reenter
the single-quoted string.)
.IP \fB%\fIzN\fR
The character with base \fIz\fR value \fIN\fR.
Bases are: \fBx\fR (16),  \fBd\fR (10), and \fBb\fR (2).
.IP \fB%\fIzM\fR-\fIN\fR
Any character with values betwen \fIM\fR and \fIN\fR inclusive,
base \fIz\fR.
.IP "\fIM\fR\fB*\fR\fIN\fR \fIexpression\fR"
Between (inclusive) \fIM\fR and \fIN\fR repetitions
of \fIexpression\fR.
The default for \fIM\fR is 0, for \fIN\fR infinity.
.IP \fB[\fR\fIexpression\fR\fB]\fR
Same as \fB0*1(\fR\fIexpression\fR\fB)\fR, that is, an 
optional expression.
.IP (\fIexpression\fR)
Expands to \fIexpression\fR.
(Use parentheses for grouping.)
.SH "BRANCH CONTROL"
Each alternative in the grammar has a weight assigned to it.
Normally, these weights are all 1.
The higher the weight, the more likely it is that
a alternative is used when expanding the nonterminal
it occurs in.
Assign specific weights to an alternative by prefixing it
with \fB{\fR\fIN\fR\fB}\fR, where \fIN\fR is an integer.
For example
.br
.in +7
nt = {30} nt x / x
.br
x = {2} 'a' / {3} 'b'
.br
.in -7
should tend to produce output that is about 2/5th 'a',
about 3/5th 'b', and fairly lengthy.
.LP
Repetition can be branch controlled with two chance parameters
that govern whether to stop or continue on each step of the
repetition.
They're placed before the two counts around the *:
.br
.in +7
nt = {1}1*{3}10 'X'
.in -7
will tend to produce somewhere around 3 Xs on average.
This is an extension to RFC 5234 and can be disabled by
specifying \-l on the command line.
