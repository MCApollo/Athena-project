.SS "Description"
\fCbg\fP sends \fCjobs\fP to the background, resuming them if they are stopped\&.
.PP
A background job is executed simultaneously with fish, and does not have access to the keyboard\&. If no job is specified, the last job to be used is put in the background\&. If PID is specified, the jobs with the specified process group IDs are put in the background\&.
.PP
When at least one of the arguments isn't a valid job specifier (i\&.e\&. PID), \fCbg\fP will print an error without backgrounding anything\&.
.PP
When all arguments are valid job specifiers, bg will background all matching jobs that exist\&.
.SS "Example"
\fCbg 123 456 789\fP will background 123, 456 and 789\&.
.PP
If only 123 and 789 exist, it will still background them and print an error about 456\&.
.PP
\fCbg 123 banana\fP or \fCbg banana 123\fP will complain that 'banana' is not a valid job specifier\&.
