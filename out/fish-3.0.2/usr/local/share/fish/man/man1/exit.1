\fCexit\fP causes fish to exit\&. If \fCSTATUS\fP is supplied, it will be converted to an integer and used as the exit code\&. Otherwise, the exit code will be that of the last command executed\&.
.PP
If exit is called while sourcing a file (using the \fCsource\fP builtin) the rest of the file will be skipped, but the shell itself will not exit\&.
