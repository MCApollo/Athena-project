# NOTE: Skipfish uses dictionary-based probes and will not run until
# you have specified a dictionary for it to use. Please read:
# #{libexec}/doc/dictionaries.txt
# carefully to make the right choice. This step has a profound impact
# on the quality of results later on.
# Use this command to print usage information:
# skipfish -h
